# Results Viewer

After analysis completes, InSARHub can display MintPy results directly on the map.

## Loading the Velocity Map

1. Open a job folder that contains MintPy outputs (`velocity.h5`)
2. Open the **View Results** panel
3. Select a timeseries file from the list (e.g. `timeseries_ERA5_ramp_demErr.h5`)
4. Click **Plot**

The velocity map is overlaid on the map with a ±0.1 cm/yr colorbar (red = subsidence, blue = uplift). Zero-displacement pixels are transparent.

## Timeseries at a Pixel

Click any pixel on the velocity map to plot the displacement timeseries at that location.

<!-- screenshot: timeseries drawer open at bottom -->

![Timeseries Drawer](fig/timeseries_dark.png#only-dark){: .doc-img-wide }
/// caption
Displacement timeseries for a clicked pixel. First date is set to zero (relative displacement).

The timeseries drawer:

- Shows displacement in **cm** relative to the first acquisition date
- Follows the app's light/dark theme
- Can be closed by clicking the × button

## Colorbar

The velocity colorbar spans **−0.1 to +0.1 cm/yr** by default:

- **Red** — negative velocity (subsidence / moving away from satellite)
- **White** — near-zero displacement
- **Blue** — positive velocity (uplift / moving toward satellite)
- **Transparent** — exactly zero (no data or reference pixels)
